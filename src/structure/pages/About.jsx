        <p>Hi! </p>
        <p>
          I’m Uliana Seredenko, a passionate and dedicated web developer based
          in Essen, Germany. I recently completed a fullstack development
          course, where I worked on real-life team projects using HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, React, and Node.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love creating user-friendly, accessible, and visually appealing web
          applications. My current focus is on building responsive front-end
          interfaces that not only look great but also work smoothly across
          devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          I approach every project with a practical mindset and a strong drive
          to learn. I believe good code is not only functional but also clean
          and maintainable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of tech, I’m into anime, drawing, and detective stories — they
          inspire my creativity and problem-solving mindset.
